Welcome to TV Pulse, a free and open-source app built by a single human (hi, that's me üëã). This is a passion project, so please be kind‚ÄîI'm just trying my best here!

The Highlights:
Your Data Stays Local: Everything stays on your device. No servers, no clouds, just your TV obsessions.
No Tracking, Ever: I don't care what you watch or where you watch it. No tracking, no snooping, zero ads.
Open Source Magic: Feel free to poke around the code, suggest fixes, or laugh at my spaghetti logic on GitHub.
No Warranties: If the app breaks, catches fire, or somehow causes you to binge a terrible show, I can't be held responsible.
By using TV Pulse, you agree to chill, enjoy, and maybe even contribute. ‚ù§Ô∏è

That‚Äôs it. Have fun tracking your TV life!
